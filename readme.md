# Algorithms and data structures in Go

_"check! check! Mic Checked"_

Recently, I decided to take seriously my mission to learn go. I know the basic concepts, the entry function and how to run a http server in this pretty cool language.

But more recently, i tried to put my knowledges on action, and I failed. Just didn't remember a thing.

**So in this Repo, we'll dive deeper some basic concepts of data structures and algorithm just to prove myself a point, I know Go.**

Just to mention, I'm on the middle of a post-graduation, so maybe it can take a while to be done or recieve updates. Stay Tunned.
